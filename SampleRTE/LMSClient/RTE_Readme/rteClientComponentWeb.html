	         		SRTE Client Component (Web Files)
	         	</h5>
	         <p>
	         	The SRTE Client Component is comprised of the following modules
	         	located in the Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient directory:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>Administrative</i>: This module contains files that change
	               passwords, delete courses, manage global objectives, create or
	               delete users, delete courses and clear the SRTE database.
	               The files that make up the Administrative module are located 
                   in the &quot;admin&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Help</i>: This module contains information pages on how to
	               use the SRTE.  The files that make up the Help module 
                   are located in the &quot;help&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Import</i>: This module is responsible for managing the course
	               import process.  These files use the SRTE Server side 
	               Java Component to handle parsing, validation and database access. 
	               The files that make up the Import module are located in the 
	               &quot;import&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Includes</i>:  The SRTE uses a style sheet (*.css)
	               that handles the interface look and feel.  See
	               sampleRTE_style.css for details.  This file is located in the
	               &quot;includes&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Run-Time</i>:  This module contains the files used to deliver
	               a SCORM-conformant Content Aggregation Content Package and the SCORM API.  
	               All images used in 
                 the SRTE menu are located in the &quot;menu-images&quot; directory 
                 of this module.  The files that make up the Run-Time 
                 module are located in the &quot;runtime&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Special State</i>: This module contains information pages that
	               describe special sequencing states.  Content
	               may not be delivered as a result of a sequencing request.  In that
	               event these pages inform the user about what state the sequencer
	               is in. <strong>Note:</strong> These pages are included to help debug sequencing
	               in content.  SCORM does not require the presence of these pages.  LMSs may handle sequencing states in their
	               own manner.  The files that make up the Special State 
	               module are located in the &quot;specialstate&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	         </ul>
