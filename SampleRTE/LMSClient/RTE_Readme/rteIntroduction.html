            Welcome to the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 
            4<sup>th</sup> Ed. SRTE Version 1.1.1.  The SRTE provides an example
            implementation of the concepts described in SCORM. Specifically, it
            provides an example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment (Application 
            Programming Interface (API) and Data Model) and 
            SCORM Sequencing and Navigation as they might be applied in a 
            learning management system (LMS) environment.  Robust exception and 
            error handling are not included in this sample code, nor were
            performance optimizations considered.
            </p>
   
            <p>
            Even though there are a number of valid web-enabled SCORM
            implementations, this version of the SRTE was implemented as a
            web-based client/server application using HTML, JavaScript,
            JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Applets and Java Servlets.  Refer to
            the &quot;Design Information&quot; section of this Readme for 
            additional SRTE design information.
