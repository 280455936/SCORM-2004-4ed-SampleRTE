			Building the SRTE
		</h5>

		<p>
			<strong> <strong>Note:</strong> You are not a required to
				build the SRTE before using it. It will install as a fully
				operational unit. You only have to build the SRTE if
				the source code has been changed. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Complete the SRTE full installation
				instructions before compiling the SRTE.</em> The SRTE build file
			depends on a full apache-tomcat-5.5.20 install, along with resources
			provided in the installation of the SRTE. When the SRTE is built, 
			it overwrites the previously installed SRTE. To revert back to the original 
			SRTE, execute the un-install and then rerun the downloaded self-extracting
			executable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apache Ant must be installed before building the SRTE.</b>  For information 
			about and downloads of Ant, refer to
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.
			<br />
			<em> To build the SRTE: </em>
		</p>


		<ol>
			<li>
				Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the SRTE is 
				installed (Default: C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_4th_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.1.1)
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to the Sample_RTE\source directory
			</li>
			<li>
				At the prompt type &quot;ant&quot;.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The XML Ant build files will compile all Java class and jar files
			needed by the SRTE. In addition the files will be installed to
			apache-tomcat. (
			<strong>Note:</strong> Restart the Tomcat server for changes to take effect. 
			This completes the compilation of the SRTE.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Source File Locations</em>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				All JSP, HTML, and JavaScript files are located at
				&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SRTE Java files are located in their respective package
				locations. For example the data model classes are located at
				&quot;org\adl\datamodels&quot;. The root of the Java source directory is
				&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\src. There
				you will find the build script and the root &quot;org&quot; directory.
			</li>
		</ul>
