            Welcome to the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 
            4<sup>th</sup> Ed. SRTE Version 1.1.1.  The SRTE provides an example
            implementation of the concepts described in SCORM. Specifically, it
            provides an example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment (Application 
            Programming Interface (API) and Data Model) and 
            SCORM Sequencing and Navigation as they might be applied in a 
            learning management system (LMS) environment.  Robust exception and 
            error handling are not included in this sample code, nor were
            performance optimizations considered.
            </p>
   
            <p>
            Even though there are a number of valid web-enabled SCORM
            implementations, this version of the SRTE was implemented as a
            web-based client/server application using HTML, JavaScript,
            JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Applets and Java Servlets.  Refer to
            the &quot;Design Information&quot; section of this Readme for 
            additional SRTE design information.

	            Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Vista SP1 and XP Professional SP3.  
	            Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 and Internet Explorer 8.0 were also
	            tested with the SRTE.  The SRTE was not formally tested with any other 
	            browsers on any other platforms than those indicated above.

	            The SRTE is available for download as a self-extracting
	            executable install file. Once you have completed 
	            downloading the file, perform the following steps:
	         </p>
	            <ol>
	               <li>
	                  Double-click the downloaded self-extracting executable 
	                  file to begin the installation process.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Click <strong>Next</strong> to continue from the &quot;Welcome&quot; page.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Read the &quot;License Agreement&quot;

	                     <li>
	                        Click <strong>Yes</strong> to agree and continue with the install.
	                     </li>
	                     <li>
	                        Click <strong>No</strong> if you do not agree with the terms 
	                        of the license and wish to exit the install.
	                     </li>

	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Choose whether you would like the SRTE to be installed

	                  another root installation directory, but the SRTE
	                  install will always append the 
	                  &quot;\ADL\SCORM_2004_4th_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.1.1&quot; sub-directory to the
	                  specified root installation directory.  The remainder

           <ul>
	              <li> For Windows XP, use the Windows Control Panel &quot;Add/Remove 
	              Programs&quot; feature:
	                 <ol>

	              Features&quot; option:
	                 <ol>	                    
	                    <li>Open the Windows &quot;Control Panel&quot;</li>

              <li>If this version of the SRTE is already installed, running the install 
                 again will uninstall the software. This method will not re-install

           second method to uninstall it.
           <br /><br />
           
           These methods of uninstalling will not remove files or directories that
           have been altered in the course of running the SRTE.  To complete the 
           process of uninstalling the SRTE, the follow these steps:

	          </p>
		        <p>
			        In addition to any User Interface (UI) controls provided within course 
			        content, the SRTE provides several mechanisms for navigating through 
			        a course that complies with Section 2.1.7 of the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. 
			        Testing Requirements.  These mechanisms include the navigation 
			        buttons in the top frame of the SRTE, such as the Quit, Suspend, 
			        Previous, and Continue buttons, and the Table of Contents provided in 
			        the left&#45;hand frame.
		        </p>
	         
		        <p>
		          <strong>Navigation Buttons</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The navigation buttons provided by the SRTE in the top frame 
		           will be visible when they are not explicitly &quot;hidden&quot; by an activity 
		           via the &quot;hideLMSUI&quot; element within the manifest.  When an activity 
		           explicitly hides any of the buttons, they will not appear in the 
		           top frame.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following section describes the behavior of the navigation buttons when 
		           they are not hidden:
		        </p>
		        
		      
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Quit &#45; This button will issue an Exit All navigation request 
			              to the SRTE's Sequencer; the SRTE will end a user's current 
			              attempt on a course.  The user's progress and course status 
			              information for the current attempt will no longer be available 
			              if  the user makes another attempt on the course.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Suspend &#45; This button will issue a Suspend All navigation request 
			              to the SRTE's Sequencer; the SRTE will end a user's 
			              current attempt on a course and will also 'bookmark' the user's 
			              position within the course.  The user's progress and course status 
			              information will persist.  When the user starts the course 
			              again, the course will resume with the same content where they 
			              triggered the suspend.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Previous &#45; This button will issue a Previous navigation request 
			              to the SRTE's Sequencer, resulting in launching the activity 
			              identified prior to the current activity in the course's activity 
			              tree.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Continue &#45; This button will issue a Continue navigation request 
			              to the SRTE's Sequencer, resulting in launching the  
			              activity identified after the current activity in the 
			              course's activity tree.
			           </li>
			        </ul>

		          <strong>Table of Contents</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           A table of contents (ToC) will be provided by the SRTE when 
		           a course includes  Choice equal to &quot;true&quot; anywhere within its 
		           activity tree.  When a course includes Choice equal to &quot;false&quot; at 
		           every level of its activity tree, the table of contents will not 
		           appear.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following describes the items in the ToC when Choice is set to 
		           &quot;true&quot; in the course:
		        </p>
		        
		       
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Selectable &#45; Items that are selectable will be indicated with 
			              black text and the cursor will change as the user moves an input 
			              device over them.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Not Selectable &#45; Items that are not selectable will be indicated 
			              by gray text or  black text and a cursor that does not change 
			              when the user moves an input device over them.

		         The SRTE Server Component is implemented using 
		         Java Servlets and Java Applications. The Servlets respond to 
		         requests from the Run-time Environment Client Component and are 
		         responsible for data model persistence as well as sequencing and 
		         parsing logic.  The source files for the server component are located
		         in the Sample_RTE\source\src directory.  In addition, the JavaDoc
		         associated with the source files is located at Sample_RTE\api\index.html.
		         The modules that make up the Server Component are listed below:

	         		SRTE Client Component (Web Files)
	         	</h5>
	         <p>
	         	The SRTE Client Component is comprised of the following modules
	         	located in the Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient directory:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>Administrative</i>: This module contains files that change
	               passwords, delete courses, manage global objectives, create or
	               delete users, delete courses and clear the SRTE database.
	               The files that make up the Administrative module are located 
                   in the &quot;admin&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Help</i>: This module contains information pages on how to
	               use the SRTE.  The files that make up the Help module 
                   are located in the &quot;help&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Import</i>: This module is responsible for managing the course
	               import process.  These files use the SRTE Server side 
	               Java Component to handle parsing, validation and database access. 
	               The files that make up the Import module are located in the 
	               &quot;import&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Includes</i>:  The SRTE uses a style sheet (*.css)
	               that handles the interface look and feel.  See
	               sampleRTE_style.css for details.  This file is located in the
	               &quot;includes&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Run-Time</i>:  This module contains the files used to deliver
	               a SCORM-conformant Content Aggregation Content Package and the SCORM API.  
	               All images used in 
                 the SRTE menu are located in the &quot;menu-images&quot; directory 
                 of this module.  The files that make up the Run-Time 
                 module are located in the &quot;runtime&quot; directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Special State</i>: This module contains information pages that
	               describe special sequencing states.  Content
	               may not be delivered as a result of a sequencing request.  In that
	               event these pages inform the user about what state the sequencer
	               is in. <strong>Note:</strong> These pages are included to help debug sequencing
	               in content.  SCORM does not require the presence of these pages.  LMSs may handle sequencing states in their
	               own manner.  The files that make up the Special State 
	               module are located in the &quot;specialstate&quot; directory.

			Building the SRTE
		</h5>

		<p>
			<strong> <strong>Note:</strong> You are not a required to
				build the SRTE before using it. It will install as a fully
				operational unit. You only have to build the SRTE if
				the source code has been changed. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Complete the SRTE full installation
				instructions before compiling the SRTE.</em> The SRTE build file
			depends on a full apache-tomcat-5.5.20 install, along with resources
			provided in the installation of the SRTE. When the SRTE is built, 
			it overwrites the previously installed SRTE. To revert back to the original 
			SRTE, execute the un-install and then rerun the downloaded self-extracting
			executable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apache Ant must be installed before building the SRTE.</b>  For information 
			about and downloads of Ant, refer to
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.
			<br />
			<em> To build the SRTE: </em>
		</p>


		<ol>
			<li>
				Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the SRTE is 
				installed (Default: C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_4th_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.1.1)
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to the Sample_RTE\source directory
			</li>
			<li>
				At the prompt type &quot;ant&quot;.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The XML Ant build files will compile all Java class and jar files
			needed by the SRTE. In addition the files will be installed to
			apache-tomcat. (
			<strong>Note:</strong> Restart the Tomcat server for changes to take effect. 
			This completes the compilation of the SRTE.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Source File Locations</em>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				All JSP, HTML, and JavaScript files are located at
				&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SRTE Java files are located in their respective package
				locations. For example the data model classes are located at
				&quot;org\adl\datamodels&quot;. The root of the Java source directory is
				&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\src. There
				you will find the build script and the root &quot;org&quot; directory.
			</li>

						<li>
							If a package manifest contains references to Sharable Content
							Objects (SCOs) that are located on an external web site, a
							cross-domain JavaScript security error will occur. This may
							prevent the SCOs from communicating with the SRTE provided
							API.
							<br />
							<br />
						</li>

						<li>
							The Internet Explorer browser must be set to check for a new page
							every visit to the page. To configure the browser:
