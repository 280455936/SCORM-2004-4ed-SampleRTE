       This SRTE implementation provides a working 
       example of the Run-Time Environment described in the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> 
       Ed.  This is not a fully functional learning management system (LMS), but 
       rather an example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment as it may be implemented 
       within an LMS.
       
       
       <br /> 
       <br />
       This sample includes:</div>
       <ul>
           <li> 
           		An API Adapter implemented as a Java Applet
           </li>
           <li> 
           		A full implementation of the SCORM Run-time Environment Data 
                Model
           </li>
           <li> 
           		A full implementation of the SCORM Navigation Data Model
           </li>
           <li> 
           		Support for importing SCORM Conformant Content Aggregation 
                Packages
           </li>
           <li> 
           		A Sequencing Engine based on the IMS Simple Sequencing 
                Specification and SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed.
           </li>
       </ul>
          
       <p>
          NOTE: This sample replaces and supersedes the SCORM 2004 4th Edition 
          Sample Run-Time Environment Versions 1.0 and 1.1.
