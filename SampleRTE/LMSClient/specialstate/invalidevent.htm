					NOTES:
					<br />
					This
					<i>[INVALIDEVENT]</i> page indicates that the ADL Sequencer
					received a navigation event that is not permissible. Look at the
					User Interface controls present during course execution and
					evaluate whether they should be visible.
					<br />
					<br />
					Typical reasons this page is being encountered include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							A Continue Navigation Request was invoked within a flow =
							False cluster.
						</li>
						<li>
							A Previous Navigation Request was invoked from the root of
							the Activity Tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							A Previous Navigation Request was invoked within a
							forward-only cluster.
						</li>
						<li>
							A Choice Navigation Request targeted an activity within a
							choice = False cluster.
						</li>
						<li>
							A Choice Navigation Request targeted an activity that is
							hidden from choice.
						</li>
					</ul>
