   NOTES:<br />
   This <i>[BLOCKED]</i> page indicates that the ADL Sequencer hit a point in the 
   conceptual activity tree that it could no longer traverse and the target activity 
   could not be delivered.
   <br /><br />
   You may have encountered this page because:
   <ul>
      <li>A Start Navigation Request failed to identify an available activity.</li>
      <li>A Continue or Previous Navigation Request encountered a disabled activity.  
         Activities can become &quot;disabled&quot; for any of the following reasons:
         <ul>
            <li>Limit Condition violation</li>
            <li>Disabled Precondition Sequencing Rule</li>
         </ul> 
      </li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted a cluster that does not 
         have an available activity.</li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted an activity that is
         &quot;constrained&quot; relative to the current activity.</li>
